# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "app".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

services:
  next-app:
    container_name: next-app
    build:
      context: frontend
      dockerfile: dev.Dockerfile

    # Set environment variables directly in the docker-compose file
    # environment:
    #   ENV_VARIABLE: ${ENV_VARIABLE} 
    #   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_VARIABLE: ${NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_VARIABLE}

    # Set environment variables based on the .env file
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./next-app/src:/src/app
      - ./next-app/public:/public
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3000:3000

  backend:
    build: 
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
    command: flask run
    

       
    # If your application exposes a port, uncomment the following lines and change
    # the port numbers as needed. The first number is the host port and the second
    # is the port inside the container.
    # ports:
    #   - 8080:8080

    # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
    # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
    # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
    # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
    # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
    # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
    #     depends_on:
    #       db:
    #         condition: service_healthy
    #   db:
    #     image: postgres
    #     restart: always
    #     user: postgres
    #     secrets:
    #       - db-password
    #     volumes:
    #       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    #     environment:
    #       - POSTGRES_DB=example
    #       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    #     expose:
    #       - 5432
    #     healthcheck:
    #       test: [ "CMD", "pg_isready" ]
    #       interval: 10s
    #       timeout: 5s
    #       retries: 5
    # volumes:
    #   db-data:
    # secrets:
    #   db-password:
    #     file: db/password.txt
